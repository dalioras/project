        A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form
        of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or
        volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of
        rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain
        ranges.

        High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level. These colder climates strongly affect
        the ecosystems of mountains: different elevations have different plants and animals. Because of the less
        hospitable terrain and climate, mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction
        and recreation, such as mountain climbing.
